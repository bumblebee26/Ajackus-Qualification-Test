# Ajackus Qualification Test
This repository contains my work of pre-internship qualification test. My target was to crate a Pothole Detection System. I trained a dataset consisting of pothole roads and plain roads. I used a pretrained Resnet-50 model to train this data. I scraped these images using the python library 'google_images_download'.
